      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>The context of our social media campaign is making people aware that having a lot of stress is unhealthy, and that our brand can help them find their calmness in life. Our promotional activity was posting on our Instagram account, and interacting with our Instagram followers.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Our reach objectives were 240 followers on the 14th of April. On the night of the 13th of April, the Instagram account had 33 followers which is 13,8% of our goal. Our strategy to gain a lot of followers within two weeks was posting regularly and making interactive stories that the Instagram followers can engage with. Our reach objectives were set too high. We didn’t think realistically, because most brands use paid advertisements that can give followers easily. We chose not to do it, and trust the algorithm. It was difficult to reach our target group because there are many Instagram brand accounts.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>On several websites, they mentioned that consistency in posting on Instagram can help you grow a following. Combining regular posting with interactive stories was highly recommended for starting businesses. Looking at our statistics from our latest Instagram post (which has been put up for 7 hours), our method did not work as well as we had hoped it did.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>In the future, we would like to do paid advertisements which can help us grow an online community even faster. With paid advertisements, more people will see it and can be more intrigued to visit our Instagram page or website. Next to Instagram, we would like to focus on TikTok as well. Our target group is very into TikTok at the moment, and gaining a following on TikTok can be much easier than on Instagram.</p>
      <p>If we had the opportunity to do this over again, we would have liked to add TikTok and Facebook to our list of social media platforms. Instagram was the easy route because we already have much experience with it. However, the challenge was limited because we knew how Instagram worked. Nevertheless, we did not meet our end goal, which is okay since our interactions were okay with the ratio between followers and likes.</p>
